<h3>People also ask</h3>

<h1>What are the 3 parts of a wedding?</h1>

<p>There is typically a welcome or introduction by the minister, followed by the exchange of vows. </p>
<p>The couple then exchanges rings, and after the couple shares a kiss, the minister announces </p>
<p>them for the first time as a married couple. </p>

<h1>How long is usually a wedding? </h1>

<p>As a rule of thumb, wedding ceremonies typically last 30 minutes to an houralthough short and </p>
<p>sweet wedding programs are okay, too and most wedding receptions typically last four to five </p>
<p>hours. </p>

<h1>What is the difference between marriage and a wedding? </h1>

<p>A marriage is a long term relationship between two individuals. A wedding, on the other hand, </p>
 <p>is the ceremony of getting married. Therefore, “You are invited to my wedding.” is correct and </p>
 <p> “You are invited to my marriage”. is incorrect usage. </p>
